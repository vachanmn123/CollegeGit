Hallo There,

Its Vachan again.

I am good at Linux too. I switched to linux when I was 13 and since then I cant go back to Windows for the life of me. I have used almost all the major wel known distros.

But essentially all I am saying is that I can use linus really well. I also gained a shit ton of experience after running my own Hosting business for quite a long time.

Byeee!
